			The Alchemist is one who is especially interested and skilled in the alchemical arts and often do this as a profession or hobby. An Alchemist will often try to solve problems and challenges put before him using this skill set. Alchemists are often above average intelligent people as alchemy is limited to those with the intellect to grasp it. The Alchemist's reasons for adventuring often aligns with interests of finding other places with different knowledge of alchemy he can learn or to find new ingredients to either improve formulas with or develop new formulas with. That said this interest does not encumber the Alchemist from dedicating himself to other situations that may erupt during his travels.

				Alchemy (Ex)
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				Alchemists are masters of creating alchemical substances such as alchemist’s fire,
				smokesticks as well as other alchemical extracts, but the reason he is a true master of potion crafting,
				is his ability to craft extraordinary amounts of potions, poisons, oils and alchemical items in a single hour
				at a fourth of the cost rounded up to the nearest copper worth of raw materials.<br /><br />

				An Alchemist usually prepares his Extracts at the beginning of his day,
				and may create any number of his daily allotment of extracts that he is able to craft without having to take a craft (alchemy) check.
				This process takes 1 hour regardless of how many extracts he creates this is due to the fact that the creation process takes one hour regardless of the amount he makes.
				The Alchemist starts play with a Lab, alchemist’s (portable), and may create his extracts as long as he has access to it or an equivalent set of items.
				He may not prepare extracts without such items.<br /><br />

				When using Craft (alchemy) to create a potion,
				poison, oil or alchemical item, an alchemist gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the Craft (alchemy) check.
				In addition, an alchemist can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions.
				He must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a check.
				The Difficulty Challenge of such a check is the same as the crafting check to make the potion in question.<br /><br />

				An alchemist can create three special types of items—extracts, bombs, and mutagens
				are transformative elixirs that the Alchemist drinks to enhance his physical
				abilities—both of these are detailed in their own sections below.<br /><br />

				Extracts is essentially normal potions, poisons, oils and alchemical items
				but is segregated under the name of extracts to avoid confusion when determining
				how many of these you may create under the special rules mentioned above.
				The difference between a potion created as an extract and a potion created with craft(alchemy)
				is the expiration date which is further detailed below.<br /><br />

				An alchemist can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day.
				His base daily allotment of extracts is given on Table: Alchemist.
				In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score,
				in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.
				Since extracts are hastily made versions of themselves they deteriorate and expire at
				a much faster rate than an equivalent crafted using craft(alchemy).
				A potion extract is potent for 1 day, during the second day there is a 75% chance for the potion extract to function as normal,
				otherwise the potion extract will cause mild drowsiness.
				On the third day the potion extract is inert and will have lost its potency completely.
				Poisons, oils or Alchemical item extracts, expire after 1 day.<br /><br />

				Extracts that the Alchemist does not use during the day and expires may be re-prepared the next day at no materials cost,
				the extracts re-prepared in this way still consumes slots from the daily allotment of extracts.
				An Alchemist has a formulae list which he carries around wherever he travels,
				this list also determines what extracts he may create.
				The alchemist uses his level as the caster level to determine any effect based on caster level.
				An Alchemist may prepare any extract from his formulae list as long as the formulae is of a level the alchemist is able to create,
				which is determined by Table: Alchemist.
				To learn or prepare an extract,
				an alchemist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the extract’s level.<br /><br />

				The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an alchemist’s extract is 10 + the extract level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier.
				An alchemist may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in writing,
				whether that is a scroll or a book or a stone tablet is up to him but he must have his formulae in writing,
				and must refer to it when creating an extract. An alchemist begins play with two 1st level formulae of his choice,
				plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modifier. At each new alchemist level,
				he gains one new formula of any level that he can create plus a number of additional formulae equal to
				his intelligence modifier that must match the same requirements.<br /><br />

				An Alchemists formulae's can't be learned by a wizard and a wizards spells can't be learned by an Alchemist.

		</div>
		<div class="Bombs">
			<h3>
				Bomb(Ex)
			</h3>
			<p>
				In addition to extracts, alchemists are experts at mixing unstable pyrotechnical alchemical components with explosive results.
				The bombs are made from alchemical components that in its prepared state is unstable and subject to spontaneous combustion or worse,
				but in the hands of an alchemist is as safe as can be.
				These components are funneled into a form shaped like a ball where the components crystallize into a somewhat transparent crystal ball,
				comparable in scale to a baseball. This crystal ball is colorless and half transparent with visible internal cracking,
				but as the alchemist masters this craft the crystal ball will become less foggy and more clear and transparent with less cracks,
				if the bombs are altered with some elemental components the ball will be colored. 
				Each element has its own color acid for example would make the crystal ball green.<br /><br />
