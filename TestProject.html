			The Alchemist is one who is especially interested and skilled in the alchemical arts and often do this as a profession or hobby. An Alchemist will often try to solve problems and challenges put before him using this skill set. Alchemists are often above average intelligent people as alchemy is limited to those with the intellect to grasp it. The Alchemist's reasons for adventuring often aligns with interests of finding other places with different knowledge of alchemy he can learn or to find new ingredients to either improve formulas with or develop new formulas with. That said this interest does not encumber the Alchemist from dedicating himself to other situations that may erupt during his travels.

			<h3>
				Alchemy<sup>(Ex)</sup>
			</h3>
			
			<p>
				Alchemists are masters of creating alchemical substances such as alchemist’s fire,
				smokesticks as well as other alchemical extracts, but the reason he is a true master of potion crafting,
				is his ability to craft extraordinary amounts of potions, poisons, oils and alchemical items in a single hour
				at a fourth of the cost rounded up to the nearest copper worth of raw materials.<br /><br />

				An Alchemist usually prepares his Extracts at the beginning of his day,
				and may create any number of his daily allotment of extracts that he is able to craft without having to take a craft (alchemy) check.
				This process takes 1 hour regardless of how many extracts he creates this is due to the fact that the creation process takes one hour regardless of the amount he makes.
				The Alchemist starts play with a Lab, alchemist’s (portable), and may create his extracts as long as he has access to it or an equivalent set of items.
				He may not prepare extracts without such items.<br /><br />

				When using Craft (alchemy) to create a potion,
				poison, oil or alchemical item, an alchemist gains a competence bonus equal to his class level on the Craft (alchemy) check.
				In addition, an alchemist can use Craft (alchemy) to identify potions.
				He must hold the potion for 1 round to make such a check.
				The Difficulty Challenge of such a check is the same as the crafting check to make the potion in question.<br /><br />

				An alchemist can create three special types of items—extracts, bombs, and mutagens
				are transformative elixirs that the Alchemist drinks to enhance his physical
				abilities—both of these are detailed in their own sections below.<br /><br />

				Extracts is essentially normal potions, poisons, oils and alchemical items
				but is segregated under the name of extracts to avoid confusion when determining
				how many of these you may create under the special rules mentioned above.
				The difference between a potion created as an extract and a potion created with craft(alchemy)
				is the expiration date which is further detailed below.<br /><br />

				An alchemist can create only a certain number of extracts of each level per day.
				His base daily allotment of extracts is given on Table: Alchemist.
				In addition, he receives bonus extracts per day if he has a high Intelligence score,
				in the same way a wizard receives bonus spells per day.
				Since extracts are hastily made versions of themselves they deteriorate and expire at
				a much faster rate than an equivalent crafted using craft(alchemy).
				A potion extract is potent for 1 day, during the second day there is a 75% chance for the potion extract to function as normal,
				otherwise the potion extract will cause mild drowsiness.
				On the third day the potion extract is inert and will have lost its potency completely.
				Poisons, oils or Alchemical item extracts, expire after 1 day.<br /><br />

				Extracts that the Alchemist does not use during the day and expires may be re-prepared the next day at no materials cost,
				the extracts re-prepared in this way still consumes slots from the daily allotment of extracts.
				An Alchemist has a formulae list which he carries around wherever he travels,
				this list also determines what extracts he may create.
				The alchemist uses his level as the caster level to determine any effect based on caster level.
				An Alchemist may prepare any extract from his formulae list as long as the formulae is of a level the alchemist is able to create,
				which is determined by Table: Alchemist.
				To learn or prepare an extract,
				an alchemist must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the extract’s level.<br /><br />

				The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against an alchemist’s extract is 10 + the extract level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier.
				An alchemist may know any number of formulae. He stores his formulae in writing,
				whether that is a scroll or a book or a stone tablet is up to him but he must have his formulae in writing,
				and must refer to it when creating an extract. An alchemist begins play with two 1st level formulae of his choice,
				plus a number of additional formulae equal to his Intelligence modifier. At each new alchemist level,
				he gains one new formula of any level that he can create plus a number of additional formulae equal to
				his intelligence modifier that must match the same requirements.<br /><br />

				An Alchemists formulae's can't be learned by a wizard and a wizards spells can't be learned by an Alchemist.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="Bombs">
			<h3>
				Bomb<sup>(Ex)</sup>
			</h3>
			<p>
				In addition to extracts, alchemists are experts at mixing unstable pyrotechnical alchemical components with explosive results.
				The bombs are made from alchemical components that in its prepared state is unstable and subject to spontaneous combustion or worse,
				but in the hands of an alchemist is as safe as can be.
				These components are funneled into a form shaped like a ball where the components crystallize into a somewhat transparent crystal ball,
				comparable in scale to a baseball. This crystal ball is colorless and half transparent with visible internal cracking,
				but as the alchemist masters this craft the crystal ball will become less foggy and more clear and transparent with less cracks,
				if the bombs are altered with some elemental components the ball will be colored.
				Each element has its own color acid for example would make the crystal ball green.<br /><br />

				An alchemist can craft a number of bombs each day equal to his class level + his intelligence modifier,
				an alchemist usually crafts his bombs at the beginning of the day when he prepares his extracts.
				A bomb once stabilized remains in this state for 1 day before crumbling and the components rendered inert.
				The material costs of making a bomb is 1 gold piece per damage dice it inflicts.
				The time required to make these bombs is 1 hour regardless of quantity made since the alchemist requires deep concentration to mix the ingredients.<br /><br />

				Drawing and throwing a bomb requires a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity.
				Thrown bombs have a range of 20 feet and counts as a ranged touch attack.
				Bombs are considered weapons and can be selected using feats such as Point-Blank Shot and Weapon Focus.
				An alchemists bomb inflicts 1d6 points of fire damage + additional damage equal to the alchemists intelligence modifier with a 5 foot splash radius.
				The damage of an alchemist’s bomb increases by 1d6 points at every odd-numbered alchemist level (this bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit or by using feats such as Vital Strike).
				Those caught within the bombs range can attempt a Reflex save for half damage.
				The DC of this save  is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier.
				Choosing to save from this damage forces you prone.<br /><br />

				If the alchemist chooses to throw the bomb at a creature instead of a square and successfully hits the target,
				then that creature does not receive the Reflex save mentioned above.
				Alchemists can learn new types of bombs as discoveries (see the Discovery ability) as they level up.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="BrewPotion">
			<h3>
				Brew Potion<sup>(Ex)</sup>
			</h3>
			<p>
				At 1st level, alchemists can brew potions, poisons, oils or craft an alchemical item of any formulae he knows using his alchemist level as his caster level.
				He does this using craft(alchemy) at the normal components cost for crafting (1/3 base price),
				when calculating how much time the crafting process requires the minimum time required is 1 hour but crafting in this manner may require longer.
				Using craft(alchemy) requires use of a lab same as extracts.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="Mutagen">
			<h3>
				Mutagen<sup>(Ex)</sup>
			</h3>
			<p>
				At 1st level, an alchemist discovers how to create a mutagen that he can craft from monster parts
				as the main ingredient in order to heighten his physical prowess at the cost of his personality.
				It takes 1 hour to brew a dose of mutagen, and once brewed, it remains potent for 1 week.<br />
				When an alchemist brews a mutagen, he selects one physical ability score—either Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
				Each of these scores have a different main ingredient that corresponds with the desired effect.
				It’s a standard action to drink a mutagen for non-alchemists and a move action for an alchemist.
				Upon being consumed, the mutagen causes the alchemist to grow bulkier and more bestial, taking on an appearance with similarities to the one the main ingredient originated from.
				This grants him a +2 natural armor bonus and a +4 alchemical bonus to the selected ability score for 10 minutes per alchemist level.
				In addition, while the mutagen is in effect, the alchemist takes a –2 penalty to one of his mental ability scores.
				If the mutagen enhances his Strength, it applies a penalty to his Intelligence.
				If it enhances his Dexterity, it applies a penalty to his Wisdom.
				If it enhances his Constitution, it applies a penalty to his Charisma.<br /><br />

				Muscle tissue from a giant is used to enhance strength,
				tendons from dark folk is used to enhance dexterity,
				powdered bone dust from a troll is used to enhance constitution.
				If someone were to consume a mutagen while already being under the effects of a mutagen
				the person must then make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the alchemists level + the alchemists intelligence modifier)
				if he succeeds he will immediately puke which provokes an attack of opportunity and he is considered flat footed,
				after puking both mutagens effects immediately ends.<br /><br />

				If he should fail then he suffers from the confused condition for the remaining duration of the first mutagen he consumed,
				when the duration of the mutagen ends so does the confusion.
				Once a minute he may attempt to retry the Fortitude save if successful he will go from being confused
				to suffering the panicked condition for 10 minutes before suffering the unconscious condition for 1 minute.
				During this minute of unconsciousness the monster like appearance recedes and his appearance returns to normal
				in addition the effects of the mutagens ends.
				After that minute is up he wakes up with a mild headache in addition to mild memory loss
				that starts from the beginning of confusion until waking up now,
				the mild memory loss is only bits and pieces here and there not the entire experience.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="ThrowAnything">
			<h3>
				Throw Anything<sup>(Ex)</sup>
			</h3>
			<p>
				All alchemists gain the Throw Anything feat as a bonus feat at 1st level.
				An alchemist adds his Intelligence modifier to damage done with splash weapons,
				including the splash damage if any. This bonus damage is already included in the bomb class feature.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="Discovery">
			<h3>
				Discovery<sup>(Ex)</sup>
			</h3>
			<p>
				At 2nd level, and then again every 2 levels thereafter (up to 18th level),
				an alchemist makes an incredible alchemical discovery.
				Unless otherwise noted, an alchemist cannot select an individual discovery more than once.
				Some discoveries can only be made if the alchemist has met certain prerequisites first, such as uncovering other discoveries.
				Discoveries that modify bombs that are marked with an asterisk (*) do not stack. Only one such discovery can be applied to an individual bomb.
				The DC of any saving throw called for by a discovery is equal to 10 + 1/2 the alchemist’s level + the alchemist’s Intelligence modifier.

				Poison Resistance<sup>(Ex)</sup>
			</h3>
			<p>
				At 2nd level, an alchemist gains a +2 bonus on all saving throws against poison.
				This bonus increases to +4 at 5th level, and then again to +6 at 8th level.
				At 10th level, an alchemist becomes completely immune to poison.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="PoisonUse">
			<h3>
				Poison Use<sup>(Ex)</sup>
			</h3>
			<p>
				Alchemists are experienced in the use of poison and starting at 2nd level,
				cannot accidentally poison themselves when applying poison to a weapon.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="SwiftAlchemy">
			<h3>
				Swift Alchemy<sup>(Ex)</sup>
			</h3>
			<p>
				At 3rd level, an alchemist can create alchemical items at an even more astounding speed.
				It takes an alchemist half the normal amount of time to create alchemical items,
				and he can apply poison to a weapon as a move action.
				This alters the time it takes to prepare extracts to 30 minutes instead of 1 hour,
				and alters the minimum craft(alchemy) time to 30 minutes as well as the time required to craft bombs down to 30 minutes.

		<div class="SwiftPoisoning">
			<h3>
				Swift Poisoning<sup>(Ex)</sup>

			<h3>
				Instant Alchemy<sup>(Ex)</sup>
			</h3>
			<p>
				At 18th level, an alchemist can create alchemical items with almost supernatural speed.
				The use of Craft(alchemy) takes only minimum 5 minutes now in addition the crafting time
				required to create an item is halved again reducing it to 1/4 of the original time it would normally require.
				He is also able to reduce the time it takes to prepare extracts and bombs to 5 minutes. When he uses Craft(alchemy)
				he must still succeed at the Craft (alchemy) check and must have the appropriate resources at hand to fund the creation.
				He can apply poison to a weapon as an immediate action.

		<div class="GrandDiscovery">
			<h3>
				Grand Discovery<sup>(Ex)</sup>
			</h3>
			<p>
				At 20th level, the alchemist makes a grand discovery.
				He immediately learns two normal discoveries,
				but also learns a third discovery chosen from the linked list below,
				representing a truly astounding alchemical breakthrough of significant import.
				For many alchemists,
				the promise of one of these grand discoveries is the primary goal of their experiments and hard work.
